## Abstract

While efficient architectures and a plethora of augmentations for end-to-end image classification tasks
have been suggested and heavily investigated, state-of-the-art techniques for audio classifications still
rely on numerous representations of the audio signal together with large architectures, fine-tuned from
large datasets. By utilizing the inherited lightweight nature of audio and novel audio augmentations,
we were able to present an efficient end-to-end (e2e) network with strong generalization ability.
Experiments on a variety of sound classification sets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness
of our approach, by achieving state-of-the-art results in various settings. Public code is available at:
